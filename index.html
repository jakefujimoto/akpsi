            On behalf of the Psi Epsilon chapter of Alpha Kappa Psi Professional Business Fraternity, I welcome you and thank you for your interest in our prestigious organization. Since its inception in 1904, Alpha Kappa Psi has been grounded upon the basis of educating its members and the public to appreciate & demand higher ideals in business and furthering the individual welfare of its Brothers during college and beyond. As the oldest and largest professional business fraternity, with nearly 240, 000 initiated Brothers worldwide and an active chapter presence across the globe, Alpha Kappa Psi serves to promote the ideals of excellence and professionalism, foster moral and intellectual advancement, and instill the principles of integrity and honor in personal and professional endeavors. In this way, Alpha Kappa Psi is unequivocally recognized as the premiere developer of principled business leaders.
            <br>
            <br>
            The Brothers of Alpha Kappa Psi, in allegiance to the Core Values of Brotherhood, Knowledge, Integrity, Service, and Unity, are defined by the pursuit of excellence in professionalism and character in conduct. With intent, the Brothers of Alpha Kappa Psi commit themselves to these higher ideals, continuing with honor the noble traditions and values exemplified by the Brothers that came before us, and defining the road to Brotherhood for those to come. In doing so, the Brothers pledge to live in dutiful purpose for one another and the principles upon which they are bound in the ultimate advancement of business and professional excellence.
            <br>
            <br>
            In adherence to these standards and traditions, the Brotherhood of the Psi Epsilon chapter wholly conforms to the principled pursuit of professional business excellence in its operative and fraternal functions both at Loyola Marymount University and within the greater Los Angeles community. Internally, as an organization open to all fields of study, our chapter includes students from the College of Business Administration, Bellarmine College of Liberal Arts, College of Communications & Fine Arts, and Seaver College of Science & Engineering. In combination with ethnic, religious, and gender diversity, the Psi Epsilon chapter values the respective knowledge, experience, character, and expertise of each and every Brother as integral to advancing an atmosphere of mutual education and brotherhood. Additionally, we seek to provide a resource to Brothers for developing professional skills such as resume writing expertise, confidence in interviewing and networking, and time management, interpersonal, and group-working skills. It is through commitment to one another and our shared fraternal values therein that each Brother is able to cultivate and maximize their personal and professional development to be effective, virtuous leaders for the future.
            <br>
            <br>
            Externally, the Psi Epsilon chapter commits itself to providing unparalleled access and education to the study and advancement of business and leadership for the students of Loyola Marymount University and the greater Los Angeles community. In hosting professional events from keynote speakers such as the Vice President of Toyota North America and the former CEO of Neutrogena to professional networking events in conjunction with the College of Business Administration, the Psi Epsilon chapter of Alpha Kappa Psi provides accessibility, opportunity, and ease of learning for students and aspiring professionals. Through our active participation in service in a range of specializations including hunger, homelessness, cancer awareness, and additional philanthropy, we work to assure a better community for our fellow man. Finally, as Brothers committed to the Core Values, we strive to be leaders both in and outside of the classroom, serving as willing and able resources to assist our peers in every capacity to obtain virtuous and productive professional & personal excellence.
            <br>
            <br>
            The Psi Epsilon chapter of Alpha Kappa Psi and its Brothers are, and shall forever be, dedicated to the building of brotherhood, improvement of communities, lifelong learning, high ethical standards, and the enhancement of the fraternity for life. In deeds and service to one another, Loyola Marymount University, and our extended society, we continue to strive ever more to actualizing these principles in the furtherance of the mission and vision of Alpha Kappa Psi. To those who are interested in becoming a Brother, we gladly welcome you to earn your spot amongst our fraternal ranks, and to those Brothers that came before us, those we are currently joined with in fraternity, Loyola Marymount University, and our greater community, we assure that upon these principles there will be no compromise. Thank you.
